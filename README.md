## What is EchoVision

EchoVision is an AR application where users' voices are visually represented in the surrounding environment, simulating the echolocation system of bats. This allows users to experience what it feels like to be a bat. <br>
EchoVision also serves as a sample project for [HoloKit](https://holokit.io/), an Open-Source Mixed Reality Headset created by Holo Interactive.
